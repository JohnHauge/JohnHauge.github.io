Each time a piston got placed on the ground in our game it automatically generates guard positions for our melee and ranged enemies. Melee enemies will be placed in a circle in-front of the piston while ranged enemies will be placed in an inner circle.
 
Once an enemy guard is spawned into the game space, it will automatically select the available guard position closest to the middle, this was to make sure that they would most lightly be guarding in the direction the player was approaching from.
