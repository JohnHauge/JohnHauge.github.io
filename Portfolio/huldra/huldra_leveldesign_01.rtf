The immediate challenge I faced in Huldra regarding level design was our camera angle and the game genre. Since we were making a replayable experience taking place in an arena, we didn't need to lead the player in any direction but rather help them understand where they were on the level and how to get to where they wanted to go.
  
I decided to use formal garden symmetrical design as inspiration for our paths and level structure, allowing me to utilize our natural ability for pattern recognition.
