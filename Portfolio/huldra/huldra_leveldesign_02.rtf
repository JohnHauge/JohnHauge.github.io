Other level design elements used to aid player navigation were to put flowers in specific locations, white flowers on the bottom part and purple flowers on the top. We also put a very distinct type of flower on path entries.

I placed a river running from the top to the bottom of the level to break the symmetrical feeling. While symmetrical level design can provide the player with better navigation, it can also make the level feel more generic and uninteresting.

Verticality served the same purpose as the river. But it also functioned as a way of separating level sections, making them feel segregated. Separation is necessary since one section is one forest health point.
