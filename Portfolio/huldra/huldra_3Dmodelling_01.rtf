The primary references for the art style in Huldra are games like (Dota2, League of Legends, Heroes of the storm). These titles served as a good reference not just because of their visual style but also because they are top-down games.
To develop the art style, I started with the asset that would be the most present in our game, the trees. I created a lot of rough suggestions and iterated on feedback from my co-developer Kenneth and others. Through this process, I developed a pipeline for the assets and a solid foundation to achieve a cohesive result.
