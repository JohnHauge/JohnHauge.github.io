I was hired as a contractor by my former lecturer/professor John Klima to help him develop a companion app for the Lisboa SOA festival in Portugal.

My responsibility in this production was to develop the front-end while conducting various research to help figure out the best approach to develop for iOS and Android.

I learned how to work with the flutter SDK and use the Dart programming language during this project.
