We played around with some ideas that we thought would make the user experience feel unique.

We decided to develop an AR  audio recording feature that allowed users to walk around in Lisboa and upload sounds that they recorded to the map. These sounds were made public so that other users could listen to the sound in that location.

The users could also enter a different AR map that showed where events were taking place. The event markers were also made Interactable, allowing users to read more about the event.
