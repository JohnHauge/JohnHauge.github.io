I wrote a system that allowed us to play the music dynamically, the instruments would play individually on a loop and if a new instrument was introduced to the same song it would wait for the loop to finish before it added the instrument, the idea was to be able to build up the music depending on what happened in the book but also allow the reader to control the phasing.
