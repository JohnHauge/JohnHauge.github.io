The book page uses two render texture that rendered two orthographic cameras for the 2d part of the game, we also used the 2D lighting system in unitys universal rendering pipeline along with the 3D lighting system for the 3d book in the main scene.

To have an effective and cohesive workflow while setting up the pages I split it up into different passes, one to get all text and images onto the pages, one to hook up the events to play out the page and additional passes to add new images / sounds or formatting the text
